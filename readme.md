the markdown in /docs works as follows:

Header consists of an id, and title.
The id determines the link of the document eg id: intro ---> .../docs/intro.html
If you'd like to add a sidebar, you could also add zero or more elements to it in order for it to show up.
Remember to add any new docs to the sidebars.json file so that the linking works properly across different docs.
